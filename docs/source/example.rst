Examples
========

Examples of how to display images and graphs are included in the ``examples`` folder of the `github repository <https://github.com/MikeHughesKent/ImageDisplayQT/>`_. 

These examples are bare-bones PyQT GUIs which displays images in sequence from either a monochrome or colour tif stack using the ImageDisplay widget, or a simple graph. Various features can be toggled using a set of checkboxes.
