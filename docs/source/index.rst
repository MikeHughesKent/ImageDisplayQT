ImageDisplayQT
====================================
ImageDisplayQT is a PyQT widget for live scientific image display in Python QT Graphical User Interfaces.

It was designed as a simple and lightweight widget that allows real-time display of images. Features include a status bar, with pixel value inspection, a draggable region of interest, zoom and pan, and several types of overlay. Monochrome images can be displayed using any colormap from matplotlib.

Install using::

    pip install ImageDisplayQT

It is developed mainly by `Mike Hughes <https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/hughes/>`_'s lab in the `Applied Optics Group <https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics>`_, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent. The package was originally developed for GUIs for in endoscopic microscopy, including fluorescence endomicroscopy and 
holographic endomicroscopy. 

The project is hosted on `github <https://github.com/MikeHughesKent/ImageDisplayQT/>`_. Bug reports, contributions and pull requests are welcome.
